        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place the bread crumbs into a small bowl, and mix the cream.
            Allow to stand until crumbs absorb the cream, about 10 minutes.
            While the bread is soaking , melt 1 teaspoon of butter in a
            skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the onion until it
            turns light brown, about 10 minutes. Place onion into a mixing
            bowl; mix with the ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt
            black pepper, nutmeg, allspice and ginger. Lightly mix in the bread
            crumbs and cream.</li>
        <li>Melt one tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat.
            Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the meat mixture per meatball,
            and form into balls. Place the meatballs into the skillet, and cook
            just until the outsides are brown, about 5 minutes, turning the
            meatballs often. Insides of the meatballs will still be pink. Place
            browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth, and cover
            with foil</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the meatballs are tender, about 40 min.
            Remove meatballs into a serving dish.</li>
        <li>To make a brown gravy, pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat.
            Whisk the flour into the pan drippings until smooth, and gradually whisk in
            enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups of liquid. Bring the gravy to
            a simmer, whisking constantly until thick, about 5 minutes. Just before
            serving, whisk in the sour cream. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
            Serve the gravy with the meatballs.</li>
